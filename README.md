# Gradient-Descent
This script performs linear regression with gradient descent. It computes and visualizes the cost function and parameter updates. The 3D plot shows the cost surface, while the 2D plot displays the data and the fitted line. It illustrates the convexity of the cost function, where lines between points lie above the curve.
